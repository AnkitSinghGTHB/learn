# Week 04: Java OOP & Collections

## 🎯 Objective
Master Java's object-oriented programming model (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes) and the Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and more). By the end of this week you should be able to design class hierarchies, use collections fluently, and tackle common interview problems that rely on these concepts.

## 📚 Topics Covered

| Day | Topic | File |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | Classes, Objects & Constructors | `01_oop_classes_objects.md` |
| 2 | Inheritance & Polymorphism | `02_inheritance_polymorphism.md` |
| 3 | Abstract Classes & Interfaces | `03_abstract_interfaces.md` |
| 4 | Access Modifiers & Encapsulation | `04_access_modifiers_encapsulation.md` |
| 5 | Collections — ArrayList & Lists | `05_collections_arraylist.md` |
| 6 | Collections — Maps & Sets | `06_collections_maps_sets.md` |
| 7 | Collections — Interview Patterns | `07_collections_interview_patterns.md` |

## 🛠️ Hands-On Projects
1. **Shape Hierarchy** — Interface + Abstract class + concrete shapes (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`)
   - Located in: `shape_hierarchy/`
2. **Student Management System** — Full OOP + Collections CRUD project
   - Located in: `student_management/`
3. **Word Frequency Counter** — HashMap-based text analysis
   - Located in: `word_frequency/`

## ✅ Success Checklist
- [ ] I can create classes with fields, constructors, and methods
- [ ] I understand `this` keyword and constructor overloading
- [ ] I can use inheritance with `extends` and call `super()`
- [ ] I understand method overriding vs method overloading
- [ ] I can explain runtime polymorphism (dynamic dispatch)
- [ ] I know the difference between `abstract class` and `interface`
- [ ] I know when to use each (interface vs abstract class)
- [ ] I understand all four access modifiers (`private`, default, `protected`, `public`)
- [ ] I can use `ArrayList` to add, remove, search, and sort items
- [ ] I can use `HashMap` for key-value storage and lookups
- [ ] I can use `HashSet` for unique element storage
- [ ] I understand `equals()` and `hashCode()` contract
- [ ] I can solve frequency-counting and duplicate-finding interview problems
- [ ] I understand the `Comparable` and `Comparator` interfaces

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Read through the lesson files in order (01 → 07)
2. Type out every code example — don't just read!
3. Complete the exercises in `exercises.md`
4. Build the three hands-on projects
5. Revisit the interview patterns in lesson 07

## 💡 Week 3 → Week 4 Connection
| Week 3 (What you know) | Week 4 (What's new) |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Primitive types & arrays | Objects & dynamic collections |
| Static methods | Instance methods & `this` |
| Fixed-size arrays | `ArrayList` (dynamic sizing) |
| Procedural code | Object-oriented design |
| `String` manipulation | `HashMap`, `HashSet` for fast lookup |
