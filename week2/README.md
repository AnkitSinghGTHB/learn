# Week 02: Python Data Structures & OOP

## 🎯 Objective
Write structured and "Pythonic" code using data structures, classes, and file handling.

## 📚 Topics Covered

| Day | Topic | File |
|-----|-------|------|
| 1 | Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dicts) | `01_data_structures.md` |
| 2 | Comprehensions | `02_comprehensions.md` |
| 3 | Object-Oriented Programming | `03_oop_basics.md` |

## 🛠️ Hands-On Project
**Contact Manager 2.0** - A CLI application that:
- Uses a `Contact` class with Name and Phone
- Saves/loads contacts from a JSON file
- Uses list comprehensions for search/filter
- Located in: `contact_manager/`

## ✅ Success Checklist
- [ ] I can use lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries effectively
- [ ] I can write list/dict comprehensions
- [ ] I can write a class with a constructor (`__init__`)
- [ ] I understand inheritance and dunder methods
- [ ] I can read/write files using `with open(...)`
- [ ] I can work with JSON data
- [ ] I can make HTTP requests with the `requests` library

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Read through the lesson files in order (01 → 05)
2. Practice with the exercise files (`ex1.py`, `ex2.py`, etc.)
3. Build the Contact Manager project
4. Complete the exercises in `exercises.md`
